在接受采访时，CDPR的任务设计师Patrick Mills向外媒Game  Informer确认，尽管《赛博朋克2077》中玩家有各种各样的选择，但你的角色在这个世界中不可能永远都采用非致命玩法。
“你扮演的是一个雇佣兵，因此游戏中并没有和平解决问题这一方案。和平通关是不可能的。记住，你是一个雇佣兵，你的职业就是暴力。”
当然这并不意味着所有任务都必须是正面枪战搞定。“我们想做的是为安静、攻击性较低的玩法提供空间，显然Demo演示中的处理很糟糕。我们完全可以避免那种糟糕的处理方式，这要看你的玩法风格了。”
《赛博朋克2077》目标是本世代主机和PC，不会跳票到下世代。
附《赛博朋克2077》预告片用的BGM：

歌词：
Come touch me like I'm an ordinary man
Have a look in my eyes
Underneath my skin there is a violence
It's got a gun in its hands
Ready to make
Ready to make
Read-
Ready to make sense of anyone anything
Anyone anything
Anyone anything
Anyone anything
Anyone anything
Anyone anything
Black holes living in the side of your face
Razor wire spinning around you [+echo]
Blistering sky
Blistering sky
Blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Come find me
Let me be the lesser of a beautiful man
Without the blood on his hands
Come and make me a martyr
Come and break my feeling
With your violence
Put the gun in my hand
Ready to take...
Ready to take...
Ready to take...
Ready to take...
...Out anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Black holes living in the side of your face
Razor wire spinning around you [+echo]
Blister in sky
Blister in sky
Blister in sky
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Black holes living in the side of your face
Razor wire spinning around you [+echo]
Blistering sky
Blistering sky
Blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don't know why
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
Personal responsibility
